 formal e theory, the precise mathematical definition of this concept is as follows: let S and T be two finite sets, called the source and target alphabets, respectively. A code {\displaystyle C:\,S\to T^{*}}C:\, S \to T^* is a total function mapping each symbol from S to a sequence of symbols over T. The extension {\displaystyle C'}C' of {\displaystyle C}C, is a homomorphism of {\displaystyle S^{*}}S^{*} into {\displaystyle T^{*}}T^{*}, which naturally maps each sequence of source symbols to a sequence of target symbols.
